* We first parse the executables using "objdump" and extract the features.
* The script is used to create corresponfing csv files for all the classes.
* All the csv files are then merged together to create the training dataframe.
* We use random forest classifier as our model.
* Prediction for the given test dataset is made accordingly.
* The LMDC_test.py fiction requires the merged dataset for training to be in the same diretory.
